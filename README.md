# Sales Forecasting System 
Welcom to Sales forecasting! which is essential for businesses to estimate future sales and plan accordingly. This project aims to develop a system that predicts future sales using historical sales data and machine learning techniques. Accurate forecasts assist in inventory planning, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

# Objective
To build a reliable sales forecasting model using historical sales data that helps businesses make data-driven decisions and optimize operations.

# Methodology
1.Dataset
The dataset includes:
Historical sales records
Date/time information
Seasonal patterns (e.g., holidays, months)
Additional features like store/location (if available)
2.Algorithms
Two primary models are considered:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Suitable for linear and short-term trends.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks): Effective in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.
3.Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Feature engineering (e.g., extracting day/month)
Normalization (for LSTM)
Train-test splitting
4.Model Evaluation
Performance is evaluated using:
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

# Implementation
Python is used for data handling and model development.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, tensorflow/keras.
Visualization tools to interpret trends and model performance.

# Results
ARIMA provided good short-term forecasts with low RMSE.
LSTM captured long-term trends effectively, though it required more data and tuning.
MAPE and RMSE scores demonstrated the modelsâ€™ accuracy (include actual values if available).

# Applications
Retail: Stock management and demand forecasting
E-commerce: Marketing campaign planning and logistics
Manufacturing: Supply chain optimization

# Conclusion
The Sales Forecasting System provides valuable insights for businesses to plan and manage resources efficiently. Combining traditional time-series models with deep learning enhances prediction accuracy.

# Future Work
Integrate real-time sales data feeds
Explore hybrid models
Build a user-friendly dashboard for live forecasting
